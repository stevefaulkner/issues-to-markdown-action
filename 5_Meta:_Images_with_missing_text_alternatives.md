## Description

When images do not have a text description it means anyone who cannot see images properly will not know what the images are for.

## User impact

If an image does not have an appropriate text description, someone who is blind and uses a screen reader or someone who has images turned off in their browser to save on bandwidth will be completely unaware of the image's purpose. If the image conveys important information, like a graph, or is critical to the operation of a control like a link or a button, then a missing text description can prevent them from completing vital tasks.

## General solution

Make sure that every image that conveys information or is used to perform an action has an appropriate text description. The text description must be clear and relevant to the context in which the image is being used.
