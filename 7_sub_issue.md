## Priority

[Low; Medium; High; Critical;Best practice]

## Pages/screens/components affected

* [Bullet list of samples - for web, make these actual links if possible]

## Description

[Short and to the point, describe exactly *where* the problem occurs and *what* the specific problem is. Use as many screenshots, code samples, screen recordings (gif or mp4), explanations of user flows to reach that particular problem, as necessary to help developers that will receive this bug find where/how this problem actually manifests itself]

[If necessary, add more information on how the issue impacts people using the site, specifically]

## Implementation guidance

[Concise description of the specific solution for fixing it. If there are different ways of tackling a problem, ideally pick the "best" as a "We recommend...". Make it clear when a solution is only one of many, and make sure you distinguish between the core *problem* needing to be addressed, and how our solution is our recommended way of doing this. It must be clear that, in most cases, developers don't *need* to use our solution if they opt for another approach that has the same outcome. What they *must* do is fix the fundamental problem.]

[Again, use as many screenshots, screen recordings, fixed/proposed code samples, links to other sources like the APG, as needed to concisely help developers fix their problem. No need to copy/paste large chunks of advice is a link to an authoritative source will also do (e.g. no need to wholesale copy/paste an APG pattern, just mention it and link to it). Try to make this as actionable as possible (though of course, some types of problems don't have a clear actionable solution and require a more "review/consider ..." type guidance)]

Refer to the related meta-issue for further general guidance on how to remediate these types of issues.

## More information

* [Bullet list of links to more information / articles / developer documentation. The resources here should be specific to the particular bug / implementation guidance (e.g. links to the specific APG pattern we recommend, and article very specifically about how to fix a particular bug). More general resources ("how to write good text alternatives" or similar) should be listed in the related meta/epic issue ticket instead. Keep resources here very specifically relevant to a developer just being assigned this bug and trying to find actionable and specific information on how to fix it]
